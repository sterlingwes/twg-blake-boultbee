# Blake Boultbee Web Redesign

This project was an effort by Team TWG a.k.a. `Team Drake 4 Blake` (&copy; Justine), during the CapitalOne Gift The Code Hackathon in Toronto.

## Prerequisites

The fastest way to get up and running is with Docker, so you'll need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview).
